1. Gene annotation?
      At all steps retain gene positions and functional annotation.
      Map these annotations to the consensus alignment. Identify conflicts and allow the user to
      select genes and annotations.

2. Profile Analysis
      Creation of positional weight matrices (and logos) from user-selected portions of the
      alignment or user-supplied sequences.
      Identification of candidate sites in aligned sequences using a PWM and a user-supplied
      threshold. Identification of conserved sites with user-supplied threshold on the number of
      sequences having a site in the given alignment position.
      Refinement of PWM by manual selection (with an editing tool) of sites to be added.


Programmatically:

  1. how to show logos? #logos are created
  2. consensus - additional row in the table (last one? first one?)
  2. what are the conflisc in the 1st question?
  3. PWM - in additional window? (Another instance of main, but without closing!)
  4. Last one easy.
